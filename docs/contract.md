### Vault Tree Contracts

The fundamental object in the Vault-Tree protocol is the **Contract**. By contract we something
that is a little bit out of the ordinary. We mean a **Distributed Cryptographic Contract**.

You can start to think of a Vault Tree Contract by envisioning a simple paper contract.
Just as a common contract can be written on a single leaf of paper, a Vault Tree
Contract is written into a single text file that can be copied and distributed to any interested party. 

Also like a common contract, a Vault Tree Contract is simply a voluntary agreement between two
or more **Counter-Parties**.

Unlike conventional agreements however, Vault Tree Contracts do not implicitly rely on third parties to
ensure conditions are met. Once written, generated, and distributed, a Vault Tree Contract is **Self-Enforcing**.

This self-enforcing property is engineered by carefully encrypting portions of
the text file, and relying on distributed payment platforms, such as the Bitcoin [Block
Chain], to unambiguously validate specified conditions.

Contracts of this type are modeled after a simple [Decision Tree], and built by assembling
a collection of [Vaults].
