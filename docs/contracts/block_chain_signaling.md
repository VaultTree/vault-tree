## Block Chain Signaling
Block Chain Signaling is a method by which contract participants can express clear
intentions via the Block chain. It is also a method of transfering symmetric
vault keys to other counter parties.

The main components of the Block Chain Signaling scheme are: 
*  **From Address**. The Block chain wallet address that is the source of all
   transfered funds. This is agreed to in advance by all parties.
*  **BTC Signal Quanity**. 
*  **Signal Address**. or the **To Address**
