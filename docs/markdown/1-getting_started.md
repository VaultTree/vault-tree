### What is Vault Tree?

Vault Tree is Domain Specific Languge (DSL) for building distributed
cryptographic contracts.

#### So what does that mean?

Contracts are the fundemental building block of our modern economy.

At its heart, a contract is simply a voluntary and structured aggreement between two or more parties.

There are many examples that we are already familiar with from our daily lives such as employment contracts and rental
agreements. Also, the sophisticated investment instruments that drive our modern financial system are just examples of standardized contracts.

The facinating subject of [Contract Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_theory) sits at the intersection of Law, Economics, and [Game Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

It's been know for quite a while that well structured contracts can be thought
of as a computer programs. If we bring cutting edge [cryptographic libraries],
and distributed virtual currencies such as [Bitcoin] into the picture, can we
change the way we view the problem of **contract enforcement**?

You can think of Vault Tree as a collection of tools that will help web developers,
businesses, and online communities explore a new way of thinking about contracts.
