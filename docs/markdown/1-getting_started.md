### What is Vault Tree?

Vault Tree is Domain Specific Languge (DSL) for building distributed
cryptographic contracts.

#### So what does that mean?

Contracts act as a fundemental building block of our modern economy.

At the heart of it, a contract is simply a voluntary and structured aggreement
between two or more parties.

There are many simple examples such as employment contracts and rental
agreements that we are familiar with from our daily lives. Also, the sophisticated investment instruments that drive our modern financial system
are just examples of standardized contracts.

The facinating subject of [Contract Theory] sits at the intersection of Law,
Economics, and [Game Theory].

It's been know for quite a while that well structured contracts can
be thought of and executed as a computer programs.

If we bring cutting edge [cryptographic libraries], and distributed virtual
currencies such as [Bitcoin] into the picture, can we change the way we think
about the contract enforcement?

You can think of Vault Tree as a collection of tools that will help web developers,
businesses, and online communities explore a new way of thinking about
contracts.
