#### The Enforcement Problem

Contracts become pointless if the terms cannot be effectly **enforced**.

This enforcement problem is handled differently depenending on the nature of
the contract and the parties involved.

One of the most important, widespread, and *decentalized* enforcement mechanisms in the business
world is the [Network of Trust]. Breach of contract, even if no leagel action is
taken, undermines the reputation of of the offending party. This can translate
into substantial costs and acts as an incentive toward honorable conduct.

In many cases however, a network of trust is an insuffecient mechanism.

When parties expect a more explict enforcement of their contract, they often
turn to *centralized* solutions. Examples could include

* Leagle action within a particular justice system
* Private third party arbitration

This type of enforcement works well when the central authority is:

* Agreed to by all contract participants
* Competent and Efficient
* Trustworthy

Centralized Enforcement is less effective or impossible when:

* Participants are distributed globally
* Business is conducted with cutting edge internet finacial systems that are
ahead of established leagal precident
* Good people are are trying to conduct basic business under extremely corrupt
or incompetent legal systems
