#### Contracts as Decision Trees

Contracts can be modeled as a [Decision Tree]. Intuitively this means that:

* The set of contract events and final outcomes for all parties involved can be
represented as a [Directed Graph]. Often, it will take the specific form of a
[Tree].
* _Events_ are represented as nodes in the graph, _Outcomes_ are events that
correspond to by [Leaf Nodes].
* Once a contract has been negotiated, the parties involved proceed down the
graph beginning at the [Root Node].
* Edges in the graph correspond to contract conditions that must be met in order
to make a valid trasition between two events.
* A *well written* contract in the eyes of all parties, corresponds to a well
structured graph.
