#### Vault Tree Developer Kit

We want to make it easy for you to get your Vault Tree development environment
up and running.

### Setup

* Download [Virtual Box]
* Install [Vagrant]
* Clone the Repo
```
  git clone git@github.com:VaultTree/vault_tree_developer_kit.git
  ```
  * Execute the script
  ```
  ./vault_tree_developer_kit.sh
  ```
  * SSH into the box
