### What is Vault Tree?

Vault Tree is a software library that lets you write and execute **Distributed Cryptographic Contracts.**

#### So what does that mean?

Contracts are fundemental building blocks of our modern economy. They are simply voluntary and structured aggreements between two or more parties.

There are many examples that we are already familiar with from our daily lives such as employment contracts and rental
agreements. Also, the sophisticated investment instruments that drive our modern financial system are just examples of standardized contracts.

The fascinating subject of [Contract Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_theory) sits at the intersection of Law, Economics, and [Game Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory).

It's been know for quite a while that well structured contracts can be thought
of as a computer programs. If we bring cutting edge [cryptographic libraries],
and distributed virtual currencies such as [Bitcoin] into the picture, can we
change the way we view the problem of **contract enforcement**?

You can think of Vault Tree as a collection of tools that will help web developers,
businesses, and online communities explore a new way of thinking about contracts.
