## What is Vault Tree?

Vault Tree is Domain Specific Languge (DSL) for building distributed
cryptographic contracts.

### So what does that mean?

Contracts act as a fundemental building block of our modern economy.

At the heart of it, a contract is simply a voluntary and structured aggreement
between two or more people.

There are many simple examples such as employment contracts and rental agreements that we are familiar with from our daily lives.

It is important to remember that the sophisticated investment instruments that drive our modern financial system
are just examples of standardized contracts.

The facinating subject of [Contract Theory] sits at the intersection of Law,
Economics, and [Game Theory].

You can think of Vault Tree as a collection of tools that will help web developers,
businesses, and online communities explore a new way of thinking about contracts. 

### The Problem of Enforcement

Contracts become pointless if the terms cannot be effectly
**enforced**. This problem of enforcement is handled differently depenending on the nature of
the contract and the parties involved.

One of the most important, widespread, and *decentalized* enforcement mechanisms in the business
world is the [Network of Trust]. Breach of contract, even if no leagel action is
taken, undermines the reputation of of the offending party. This can translate
into substantial costs and acts as an incentive toward honorable conduct.

In many cases however, a network of trust is an insuffecient mechanism.

When parties expect a more explict enforcement of their contract, they often
turn to *centralized* solutions. Examples could include leagle action within the
justice system of thier jursidiciton or private third party arbitration.

This enforcement works well when there is a competent, efficient, and
trustworthy central authority aggreed to by all contract participants. It is
less effective, for example, when participants are distributed globally and are conducting business with a cutting edge internet finacial system.
