### Submitting a New Contract

I encourage anyone interested, to submit new and innovative contracts. Here are some items to keep in mind when you are ready to contribute:
  * Vault Tree was designed so that smart people of all different backgrounds could design and execute contracts. Don't feel that you need to be a programmer to get started.
  * Try to familiarize yourself with Github best practices. Do you best understand Pull Requests before you attempt to submit.
  * The website documentation and example contracts is are found in the `features/` dir of the project.
